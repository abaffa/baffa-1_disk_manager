# Baffa-1 Disk Manager for Baffa-1 HomebrewCPU Minicomputer Emulator [![Hackaday.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackaday.io--blue.svg)](https://hackaday.io/project/183265-baffa-1-homebrewcpu-minicomputer)

This is a disk manager for Baffa-1 HomebrewCPU Minicomputer - a CPU and Minicomputer made from 74-Series Logic and based on Sol-1 Architecture proposed by Paulo de Tarco Constantino Junior (http://sol-1.org).

I've written an emulator for software testing that is running at http://baffa-1.baffasoft.com.br.

The emulator software is available at https://github.com/abaffa/baffa-1_emulator.

File example.dsk is an example of disk image.
